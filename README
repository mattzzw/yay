About yay
---------

yay is a simple viewer for planar 4:2:0 YUV pictures and
sequences. 

One nice thing about yay is that it tries to find width and height
parameters in the path or filename of the yuv file. So if your file is
named something like mobile_352x288.yuv you don't have to specify
width and height.

Optionally you can provide width and height parameters via "-s
<width>x<height>" paramter.
